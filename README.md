## Skeleton
To design and develop the wireframes I first used Balsamiq, then used Snipping Tools to create PNG versions. The wireframes images are designed to collaspe.

## Surface
## Colours
Each page is design with very simple colours and images to showcase the island. The colours I have used are as follows:
> - #FFCC51 - used as a background color for the footer and navbar
> - #050505 - used for the site brand and nav links
> - #009688 - used to style the quiz text.

## Typography
For the most part of I have used the Titilium Web Google font, with a fallback of Sans Serif should Titilium Web not work.

## Imagery
Througout the site I have used clear images showcasing Santorini's natural beauty.

## Design
> The site is made up of three pages, using a simple and clean design.
